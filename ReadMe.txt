The Project folder is structured in the following way:

. ipynb folder contain all the codes: - Genomics_mRNAClassification -> Contains the code that analyze Gene Expression.
				      - manifestFiltering -> Contains the code that filter out the WSImages manifest.
				      - WSI_ImageClassification -> Contains the code that analyze Whole Slide Images.
				      - ConsensusClassifier -> Contains the code that integrate the analysis of Gene
							       Expression and WSI in a Consensus Classifier.

. csv_Results folder contain the results of the IMPROVEMENT.

. BioinfoProject_Report.pdf : Contains the Report of this project.

. BioinfoProject_Slides : Contains the slides for the presentation of this project.


The .ipynb files contains all cells ran and the corresponding results for this project.
Is suggested to load these files on Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb).
In this way the results of all the cells can be seen.

If is necessary for you to run all the cells to see properly if they works, i suggest to share my Drive with you in order to be able to load the data and see the results.
The amount of data was too large to work with my local drive, so i decide to load all data into my google drive and load them with Colab.
Please give me a feedback if this way is fine for you, otherwise tell me how is needed to be this part of the project presentation.
