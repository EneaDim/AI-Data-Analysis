# AI Data Analysis for Genomics and Whole Slide Images data

Data are downloaded from the <b>Genomic Data Common Portal</b> (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/)

The Project folder is structured in the following way:

- ipynb folder contain all the codes: 
				
				- Genomics_mRNAClassification -> Contains the code that analyze Gene Expression.
				
				- manifestFiltering -> Contains the code that filter out the WSImages manifest.
				
				- WSI_ImageClassification -> Contains the code that analyze Whole Slide Images.
				
				- ConsensusClassifier -> Contains the code that integrate the analysis of Gene
							       Expression and WSI in a Consensus Classifier.

- csv\_Results folder contain the results of the IMPROVEMENT.

- BioinfoProject\_Report.pdf : Contains the Report of this project.

- BioinfoProject\_Slides : Contains the slides for the presentation of this project.


The .ipynb files contains all cells ran and the corresponding results for this project.
Is suggested to load these files on Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb).
In this way the results of all the cells can be seen.
